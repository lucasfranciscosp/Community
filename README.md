# Community

This was a challenge we encountered at the Apple Developer Academy, where we aimed to create an app that would make a positive impact on the world in just one month.

So, we developed 'Community,' an app that allows you to discover communities in your vicinity, those with which you share a connection, and potentially make new friends through it.

The user is able to create a community, to see a community next to him, to delete his own community, and to log in with AppleID.

We used UIKit, CloudKit, and also CoreLocation.

Futhermore we had to make a "admin" filter , because we didn't want to have any community in the app that inflicts the humans rights.
